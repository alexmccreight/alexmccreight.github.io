## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachlor of Arts in applied mathematics and statistics at Macalester College. This summer I hope to find a research opportunity either in the Twin Cities or in my hometown, Kansas City. In my free time I enjoy playing the drums, watching football, and working out.
